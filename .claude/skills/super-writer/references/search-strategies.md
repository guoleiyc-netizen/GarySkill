## Tool Selection Strategy

### web_search vs web_fetch

**Use web_search when:**
- Need quick overview or summary
- Looking for multiple sources
- Gathering diverse perspectives
- Initial reconnaissance
- News and current events
- Statistical data points

**Use web_fetch when:**
- Found specific valuable article
- Need complete detailed content
- In-depth research report
- Comprehensive methodology
- Long-form analysis
- Reference documents

**Typical Pattern:**
```
Stage 3 execution:
├─ web_search (2-5 times) → Get overview, find sources
└─ web_fetch (1-2 times) → Deep dive on best sources found
```

## Chinese-English Search Coordination

### Coordination Patterns

**Pattern 1: Parallel Broad Search**
```
Use when: Topic has both domestic and international dimensions
Example: AI trends, content marketing strategies

Chinese: "人工智能趋势 2025"
English: "AI trends 2025"

Result: Complementary perspectives, fuller picture
```

**Pattern 2: Sequential Deep Dive**
```
Use when: Starting broad, then going specific

Step 1 (Chinese): "内容营销" (broad overview)
Step 2 (English): "content marketing ROI measurement" (specific depth)

Result: Foundation + specialized knowledge
```

**Pattern 3: Comparative Analysis**
```
Use when: Need to compare approaches

Chinese: "中国品牌故事策略"
English: "western brand storytelling strategy"

Result: Cultural comparison, diverse approaches
```

**Pattern 4: Verification Cross-Check**
```
Use when: Need to verify information

Chinese source: [Claim about market size]
English source: Cross-check with international data

Result: Validated, credible information
```

### Language Selection Examples

| Topic | Chinese Search | English Search | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Tesla marketing | ✅ | ✅ | Global brand, both markets |
| Baidu SEO | ✅ | ❌ | China-specific |
| Facebook ads | ❌ | ✅ | Not in China market |
| AI writing tools | ✅ | ✅ | Global technology |
| Chinese e-commerce | ✅ | ✅ | Domestic + international perspective |
| Local restaurant story | ✅ | ❌ | Local business |

## Special Scenarios

### Limited or No Search Results

**If search yields poor results:**

1. **Broaden keywords** - Remove specific terms
2. **Try alternative phrasing** - Different words, same concept
3. **Search in other language** - Chinese if searched English, vice versa
4. **Look for related topics** - Adjacent or parent categories
5. **Use more general industry terms** - Step back from specifics

**If truly nothing found:**
- Inform user honestly
- Offer to create based on general knowledge
- Suggest user provide materials

### Time-Sensitive or Breaking Topics

**For very recent events/trends:**
- Include "2025" or current month/year in search
- Use "latest" or "recent" modifiers
- Search news sources specifically
- Check official announcements first

### Niche or Specialized Topics

**For obscure or highly specialized:**
- Start with broader category search
- Find industry-specific sources first
- Look for expert communities (Reddit, specialized forums)
- Academic sources may be more relevant
- LinkedIn posts from practitioners
