## Special Considerations

### When to Use Single Method

**Only Keyword Extraction:**
- Very short reference (tweet, headline)
- Only need topic overview
- SEO-focused mimicry

**Only Sentiment Analysis:**
- Only emotional tone matters
- Very limited time
- Simple content

**Only Rhetorical Analysis:**
- Pure persuasive copy
- Ad copy deconstruction
- Clear persuasive focus

**Generally avoid single method** - combinations provide richer insights

---

### When to Use Three Methods

- Complex, high-value reference content
- Level 3 complexity assignments
- Brand story with style mimicry
- User explicitly requests deep analysis
- Reference is exemplary/masterful

---

### Cultural and Language Considerations

**Chinese Content:**
- Cultural context matters more (consider Discourse)
- Idioms and chengyu (consider Close Reading)
- Indirect communication style (consider Rhetorical)

**English Content:**
- More direct persuasion (Rhetorical often useful)
- Clear sentiment expression (Sentiment works well)
- Strong narrative traditions (Narrative when applicable)

**Mixed Language Content:**
- Use methods suited to each section
- Consider cultural framing differences
- Note language-specific style elements

---

## Output Integration Guidelines

After conducting analysis with selected methods:

1. **Synthesize Findings** - Don't just list results from each method
2. **Identify Patterns** - Where methods agree or complement
3. **Note Contradictions** - Where methods reveal different aspects
4. **Prioritize Features** - What's most distinctive/important
5. **Create Style Tags** - 3-5 keywords capturing essence
6. **Make Actionable** - How to apply in Stage 7
